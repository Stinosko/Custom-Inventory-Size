# Custom-Inventory-Size

So how to compile my mod: get the general SML for satisfactory modding here: https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/tree/Development . 
Open SatisfactoryModLoader.sln this repository, add existing project and link to the mod i gave you and then it should be able to compile.
